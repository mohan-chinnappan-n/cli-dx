## Usage
```bash
sfdx mohanc:ai:openai:completion -h

```

```

 Using OpenAI given a prompt, tool will return one or more predicted completions. Also summary of the prompt if op flag is set to 's'. Also generates Ideas if op flag is to 'i'. Provides the fix for the given python code if op flag is set to 'py_bug_fix

USAGE
  $ sfdx mohanc:ai:openai:completion

OPTIONS
  -i, --inputfilename=inputfilename                Input file name where we have stored to code

  -k, --keyfilename=keyfilename                    Your OpenAI key file json, containing: OpenAI-Organization  and API 
                                                   Key

  -m, --maxtoken=maxtoken                          Max Token parameter to the engine

  -o, --op=op                                      op flag ( s for summary, i for ideas, py_bug_fix for fixing the given 
                                                   python code)

  -p, --prompt=prompt                              Your prompt, tool will complete your prompt

  -v, --targetdevhubusername=targetdevhubusername  username or alias for the dev hub org; overrides default dev hub org

  --apiversion=apiversion                          override the api version used for api requests made by this command

  --json                                           format output as json

  --loglevel=(trace|debug|info|warn|error|fatal)   logging level for this command invocation

EXAMPLE

     ** Using OpenAI given a prompt, tool will return one or more predicted completions. Also summary of the prompt if 
  op flag is set to 's'. Also generates Ideas if op flag is to 'i'. Provides the fix for the given python code if op 
  flag is set to 'py_bug_fix **

      sfdx mohanc:ai:openai:completion -k keyfile.json  -p 'prompt' -o 's or i or py_bug_fix' -m 'max tokens 
  (default:8)'


      Example:

           # Let us complete the given prompt (sentence)
           sfdx mohanc:ai:openai:completion -k myKeyfile.json -p "Once upon a time"
        
           # Let us get Summary the given prompt (sentence)
           sfdx mohanc:ai:openai:completion -k myKeyfile.json -p "Once upon a time...." -o s 

           # Let us get Ideas the given prompt (sentence)
           sfdx mohanc:ai:openai:completion -k myKeyfile.json -p "Once upon a time...." -o i 

           # Let us correct given buggy pythong code file in -i option with 200 max tokens
           sfdx mohanc:ai:openai:completion  -k ~/.openai/keys.json  -o py_bug_fix -i ~/.openai/buggy.py -m 200

- About Jupiter 

```

sfdx mohanc:ai:openai:completion -k ~/.openai/keys.json -p "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.[19] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast visible shadows,[20] and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.\n\nJupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements,[21] but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator)" -o s
